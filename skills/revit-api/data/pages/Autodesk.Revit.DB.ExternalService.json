Services need to be registered before Revit ends its initialization. For external applications that means they have to register their services during OnStartup. This will give servers which need to register to services a chance to do so during the ApplicationInitialized event, which is raised after a successfully processing OnStartup routines. A service can be registered as either recordable or non-recordable. It is expected that a service that is once registered as recordable will always be registered as recordable. Failure to comply with this policy may lead to data loss in some documents when they are opened in a Revit session with the service currently registered as non-recordable. A service is supposed to be executed only by the application that registered it. To enforce this requirement, the registering method return an execution key (a Guid) that is required as an argument to ExecuteService methods. If the owner of a service allows executing it by anyone, it needs to register it as a public service (via the option argument).

This will give servers which need to register to services a chance to do so during the ApplicationInitialized event, which is raised after a successfully processing OnStartup routines. A service can be registered as either recordable or non-recordable. It is expected that a service that is once registered as recordable will always be registered as recordable. Failure to comply with this policy may lead to data loss in some documents when they are opened in a Revit session with the service currently registered as non-recordable. An application registering a service must specify a policy to follow when executing the service. Once set, the policy remain constant during the Revit session, but a different policy may be used next time, if there is ever a need for such a change. More about the various execution policies can be found in the description of the ExecutionPolicy enumerated type. A service is supposed to be executed only by the application that registered it. To enforce this requirement, the registering method return an execution key (a Guid) that is required as an argument to ExecuteService methods. If the owner of a service allows executing it by anyone, it needs to register it as a public service (via the option argument).

If the service was registered as non-recordable, changes to the model may still be made, but the framework does not assume any explicit or implicit correlations between the document changes and servers that caused them, therefore it is not recorded which server did what. This fact is very important, particularly in work-sharing environment. If it may happen that different local users can have different servers installed and available, it is imperative for a non-serialized service that its servers are completely compatible with (or indifferent to) document modifications made by other servers of the same service.
